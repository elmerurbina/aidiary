# AI Diary - Final Exam for Database I

**AI Diary** is a web application designed as a personal diary assisted by artificial intelligence. It allows users to record and retrieve daily entries, interact with a chatbot, and manage their user profile. This project is part of the final exam for the **Database I** course.

---

## Description
AI Diary is a Flask-based web application that integrates a PostgreSQL database to store user data and diary entries. Users can interact with a chatbot to retrieve information from specific dates or add new entries. The application also includes a user profile management system where users can update their name, email, password, and profile photo.

## Functionalities
1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Users can sign up and log in to access their personal diary.
   - Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database.

2. **Diary Entries:**
   - Users can write and save daily entries.
   - The chatbot allows users to retrieve entries from specific dates using commands like:
     ```
     quiero saber mis entradas del d√≠a yyyy-mm-dd
     ```

3. **Chatbot Interaction:**
   - The chatbot guides users to add new entries or retrieve old ones.
   - Provides dynamic responses based on user input.

4. **Profile Management:**
   - Users can update their profile information (name, email, password, and photo).
   - Passwords are only updated if a new one is provided; otherwise, the existing password is retained.

5. **Profile Photo:**
   - Users can upload a profile photo via a URL.
   - The photo is displayed in the navigation bar.
